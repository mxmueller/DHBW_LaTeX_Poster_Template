### Sizing

  By default the size of the page is A1, and the scaling is given by various font definitions in the `beamerthemeMeInBio20XX.sty` as well as the top of `example20XX.tex`, however if you wish to perserve all proportions but simply change the absolute size (e.g. convert A1 to A4) then do:
  
  `pdfjam --outfile myoutput.a4.pdf --paper a4paper myinput.pdf `
